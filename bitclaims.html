             <h3 class="bitc">The Vision</h3>

              The founders of BitClaims wanted to do something big: use blockchain technology to build price transparency within the primary care market. The team had a great idea, but no product. Devin Halladay and I were asked to translate this vision into something that could be handed off to developers. We realized we needed to research and build internal consensus before the deign process could begin. The first step was to understand the core BitClaims value proposition.

      <h3 class="bitc">Price Transparency</h3>
      The product allows users to explore primary care services, see pricing, and purchase a plan. This is significant because many feel cheated by high medical costs, ambiguous pricing, hidden fees and inconsistent insurance coverage. BitClaims surfaces pricing so that users can make informed healthcare decision in a marketplace that incentivizes reducing patient costs.</div> 
    </div>
    <div>
    
      <div class="work_words">
      <h3 class="bitc">Power in Numbers</h3>
      
      BitClaims allows patients to form pools. Pools can create terms of entry building a patient pool with significant bargaining power. These groups can advocate for lower pricing and bundle their care together in order to receive bulk discounts. This incentivizes healthy life styles on the part of  the patient and can create downward price pressure within the market place.</div> 
    </div>
    <div>
    
     <div class="work_words"> 
     <h3 class="bitc">Patient Choice</h3>
     
     All of this is rooted in patient choice. Not only does BitClaims surface service price points, it also surfaces the features of a plan, facility information and doctor profiles. This give the user the information they need to make well informed healthcare decisions, from their phone. By contrasting price point with other information, patients can find the choice that fits their needs.</div>

With this information, Devin and I were able to begin the design process. However, we had to consult with business design and the development team to determine the appropriate platform for the product. Ultimately, after considering development costs and with pressure to release a minimum viable product, it was determined we would d build a mobile first web app.
